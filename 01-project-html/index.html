            <p>
                These cute WARAWARA, what is their story? The warawara are the unborn human souls
                of the Sea World in The Boy and the Heron. They desire to fly up and enter Mahito's world: to be born as
                humans. On the way, they are sometimes eaten by Pelicans.

                How do we interact with this creature?
            </p>
            <p>
                Feed FISH GUTS to mature. When they mature, they will fly up. Eventually, shoot fireworks to ward of the
                Pelicans and help the warawara complete their journey.
